# Responsive Challenge: Dawg Coffee

This folder contains your submission for the [responsive challenge](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/responsive). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What is the URL of this site, as hosted on your student webserver (i.e., students.washington.edu/<code>{uw-new-id}</code>/info343/<code>{project-name}</code>) #####
> http://students.washington.edu/dthoang/info343/dawg-coffee/

##### 2. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> Mike Sitthideth
> Students from the TE lab who I believe I have already taken the class (2)
> Alison (unsure of last name)

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> No

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> 15 - 16 hours. I feel like this is mainly attributed to not getting a strong enough foundation in class/lab. More practice before jumping in to so much would be helpful. Of course, the added links to everything really helped.

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> I really would appreciate learning more about coding SVGs in class, I felt like understanding their syntax was a little trickier until explicitly shown.
> Also, it would for sure be helpful going through columns/rows/bootstrap more thoroughly. I don't know about other students, but I definitely asked them about working with bootstrap and formatting things correctly. I think by the end, I might have unintentionally worked around some kinks by using padding instead of columns (mainly concerning the Headline/motto area).
